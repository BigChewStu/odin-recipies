        <ol>

            starts to render, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onion and bell pepper; continue to cook until vegetables have softened and 
            beef is cooked through, 3 to 5 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and garlic powder; season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low and 
            simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide meat mixture evenly among hamburger buns.</li>
